        <h5>THE GAZING GLOBE by EUGENE PILLOT</h5>
        
            <h6 class=" name zama">ZAMA.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Ohano--Ohano! Where do you be, child?</p>

     <p class="dir">[_Listens, looks about, sees drawn shade at the rear, and sighs as
     she goes to it and starts to raise it._]</p>

    <p class="dir">[_As the shade rolls out of sight we see through the open window a
     bit of quaint cliff garden that overlooks a sea of green. The rocks
     are higher on the left, near the window, where a purple-pink vine
     in full blossom has started to climb. At the right the rocks slope
     down to the sea. At centre, stone steps lead up to a slender stone
     pedestal that holds a gazing globe, now a brilliant gold in the
     late afternoon sunlight._ OHANO, _with hands clasped round the
     globe, is gazing at it. She is a woman of the early twenties,
     beautiful and gowned in a flowing kimono-like robe of green with
     embroideries of white and blue._]</p> 

<h6 class="name zama">ZAMA.</h6>
<p class="dir"> [_In a chiding, motherly way._]</p>
    
<p class="speech"> Ohano, my child, you must not be
so much at that evil ball! How many times be I not telling you it is an
_enchanted_ ball?<p>

<h6 class="name ohano">OHANO.</h6>
<p class="speech"> Yes, Zama, I hope it is enchanted. I've tried every other means
to gain the way to my heart's desire--and they've all failed me. The
story these islanders have woven round this gazing globe may be but a
myth--but if it shows me the way to my freedom, I shall not have looked
at it in vain.</p>

<h6 class="name zama">ZAMA.</h6> 
<p class="speech">Be you forgetting, child, 'tis said that evil ball shows only the
way to destruction!</p>

<h6 class="name ohano">OHANO.</h6>
<p class="speech"> Yes, these island people will create any myth, go any length, to
keep one thinking, living in their narrow way. You are destined for evil
if you try to follow the urge of your own heart--oh, yes, I know.</p>

<h6 class="name zama">ZAMA.</h6>
<p class="speech">But _your_ heart, child, should only be wanting the love of Nijo.</p>

<h6 class="name ohano">OHANO.</h6>
<p class="speech"> Nijo--I am hoping that he will be big enough to help me--but my
lover has been away so long----</p>
