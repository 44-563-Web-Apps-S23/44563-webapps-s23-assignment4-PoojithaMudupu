        <p class="speech"> There--see, he's just coming ashore--oh, Nijo! And look, Zama,
        look what the people crowding round him have done--look!</p>
        
       <h6 class="zama"> ZAMA.</h6>
       <P class="speech"> What? My poor eyes be yet uncertain. What do they be doing to your
        lover?</P>
        
       <h6 class="ohano"> OHANO.</h6>
       <p class="speech"> They have put upon him the Robe of Flame--to greet him with the
        highest honor of the island.</p>
        
       <h6 class="zama"> ZAMA.</h6>
       <p class="speech"> So they be. The robe they say the gods themselves did wear when
        time did first begin. Nijo must come back a great warrior now--a great
        warrior!</p>
        
       <h6 class="ohano"> OHANO. </h6>
        <p class="speech">Oh, how wonderful to return from the wars like that! Zama, I want
        to--I _must_ go out into the world and do great things too, like Nijo.</p>
